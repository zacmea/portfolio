# Welcome to Zachary Mears' portfolio!

## Build

This is a Vue 3 app, created using the "init vite" command, rather than "create vite".  It is styled using Tailwind CSS and is deployed on Vercel, following the [advice of Popoola Temitope](https://blog.logrocket.com/top-services-deploy-vue-app-free/).  In choosing the product type to set up the deployment, I selected "Vite" (which was pre-selected) instead of "Vue". 

## Project Setup

If you'd like to play around with the code, feel free to clone down the repo and open the project using your favorite IDE (I like VS Code).  Then run ```npm install ``` to install necessary dependencies.  You can then run the ```,npm run dev``` command to run the project locally.
